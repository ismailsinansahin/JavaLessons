// If the score is greater than or equal to 50 but less than 100, it is regarded as a half-century.
// If the score is greater than or equal to 100 but less than 200, it is regarded as a century.
// If the score is greater than or equal to 200, it is regarded as a double-century.
// NOTE: No scenario of the triple-century in this case.
// Write the code to print the number of half-centuries, centuries and double-centuries scored by the batsman.
